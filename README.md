# Twitter Feed Monitor For Discord Webhook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have your webhook URL - If you have no idea what webhook is, check out this [official page about webhooks](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

### First start
Just open [index.html](index.html) and paste in your Webhook URL. Then click Send Newest Tweets. Your tweets should appear in channel where the webhook is.

`Submitted webhook will be stored in your local storage, so you don't have to copy it everytime you want the news :)`
### Tweets
If you want different people in your feed, just use [twitter publish](https://publish.twitter.com/) and replace line 13/14/15

## Future Plans
- Checking for new tweets every x minutes
- Storing IDs to avoid posting duplicate tweets
